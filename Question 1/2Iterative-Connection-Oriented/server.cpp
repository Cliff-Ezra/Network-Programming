// An Iterative Connection-oriented server handles requests from one client at a time in an iterative manner. 
// It establishes a connection with the client before exchanging data.

// In the code example you provided, the server uses a stream socket (SOCK_STREAM) to establish a TCP 
// connection with the client using the accept() function. Once a connection is established, the server 
// receives data from the client using the recv() function and sends data back to the client using the 
// send() function. The client establishes a TCP connection with the server using the connect() function 
// and sends data to the server using the send() function. The client receives data from the server using the recv() function.

// The server receives a serial number, registration number and name from the client and checks if 
// the serial number and registration number already exist in a file. If they donâ€™t exist, the server 
// adds them to the file along with the name. The server sends confirmation messages back to the client after each operation.
